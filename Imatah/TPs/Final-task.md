# Task 4: Cloud Integration and Application Completion
## Objective
Complete the Imatah application by integrating cloud storage and implementing full CRUD functionality for reports.

## Part 1: Backend as a Service (BaaS) Integration
In this part, you will integrate a cloud-based backend service to store and retrieve application data.

### Requirements:
1. Choose and integrate either Firebase or Supabase as your BaaS solution
2. Implement the following cloud features:
   - Remote data storage for reports
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Proper error handling for network operations
3. Update the existing repository implementations to work with the cloud service
4. Ensure offline functionality with local caching
### Implementation Steps:
1. Configure BaaS Service
   
   - Set up project in Firebase Console or Supabase Dashboard
   - Add necessary dependencies to your project
   - Initialize the service in your application
2. Refactor Repository Layer
   
   - Create cloud data sources
   - Implement repository pattern with both local and remote data sources
   - Add proper synchronization logic
3. Update ViewModels
   
   - Modify existing ViewModels to handle asynchronous cloud operations
   - Add loading states and error handling
## Part 2: Complete Application Functionality
In this part, you will implement the remaining CRUD operations and search functionality.

### Requirements:
1. Complete report management features:
   
   - Create: Finish the Add Report functionality
   - Read: Implement report details view
   - Update: Add ability to edit existing reports
   - Delete: Implement report removal
2. Implement advanced search functionality:
   
   - Search by report name
   - Filter by categories
   - Sort by status or date created
### Implementation Steps:
1. Complete Report Management UI
   
   - Create edit report screen
   - Add delete confirmation dialog
   - Implement report detail view
2. Enhance Search Functionality
   
   - Create advanced search UI
   - Implement filter logic in ViewModel
   - Add sorting options
3. User Experience
   
   - Add loading indicators
   - Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add animations for smooth transitions
## Bonus Challenge: User Authentication and Authorization
### Requirements:
1. Implement user authentication:
   
   - Registration
   - Login/Logout
   - Password reset
2. Associate reports with users:
   
   - Store user ID with each report
   - Implement permissions (users can only edit/delete their own reports)
3. Add user profiles:
   
   - Profile information
   - User's report history
### Implementation Steps:
1. Set Up Authentication
   
   - Configure auth providers in your BaaS
   - Create login and registration screens
   - Implement session management
2. Update Report Logic
   
   - Modify report model to include user ID
   - Update repositories to filter by user when appropriate
   - Add permission checks before edit/delete operations
## Deliverables
1. Fully functional application with cloud integration
2. Complete CRUD operations for reports
3. Advanced search and filter functionality
4. (Bonus) User authentication and report ownership
## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and architecture
- Proper implementation of cloud services
- User experience and interface design
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization
Good luck!
